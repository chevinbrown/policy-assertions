[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/ProctorU/policy-assertions.svg?style=shield&circle-token=7084a829c9e63b415f59e627d9e4ee90db7d2afa)](https://circleci.com/gh/ProctorU/policy-assertions) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/policy-assertions.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/policy-assertions)

Minitest test assertions for [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) policies.

policy-assertions provides a test class for easy Pundit testing. The test class provides assertions and refutations for policies and strong parameters.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'policy-assertions'

# if using Rails you can add it to your test block:

group :test do
  gem 'policy-assertions'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install policy-assertions

**Add require policy_assertions to test_helper.rb**

```ruby
require 'policy_assertions'
```

## Usage

policy-assertions is intended to make testing Pundit policies as simple as possible. The gem adds the following helpers:

* PolicyAssertions::Test class
* parses permissions to test from method name
* assert_permit and refute_permit methods
* assert_strong_parameters

The following code sample illustrates the intended use of this gem.

```ruby
# The class is named after the policy to be tested.
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test

  # Test that the Article model allows index and show
  # for any site visitor. nil is passed in for the user.
  def test_index_and_show
    assert_permit nil, Article
  end

  # Test that a site staff member is allowed access
  # to new and create
  def test_new_and_create
    assert_permit users(:staff), Article
  end

  # Test that this user cannot delete this article
  def test_destroy
    refute_permit users(:regular), articles(:instructions)
    # Alternate method name
    assert_not_permitted users(:regular), articles(:instructions)
  end

  # Test a permission by passing in an array instead of
  # defining it in the method name
  def test_name_is_not_a_permission
    refute_permit nil, Article, 'create?', 'new?'
  end

  # Test that a site staff member has access to the
  # parameters defined in the params array.
  # Site visitors should not have access to any Article attributes
  def test_strong_parameters
    params = [:title, :body, :tags]
    assert_strong_parameters(users(:staff), Article,
                             article_attributes, params)

    assert_strong_parameters(nil, Article, article_attributes, [])
  end
end
```

If policies are namespaced, the invocation of the class name should follow the same syntax as Pundit.

```ruby
# Test that the Organizations::Article model allows index and show
# for any site visitor. nil is passed in for the user.
def test_index_and_show
  assert_permit nil, [:organizations, Article]
end
```

## Test method naming

policy-assertions can read the permissions to test from the method name. This will only work when using the minitest def test_name syntax. When using the block syntax, you must explicitly pass the permission names.

```ruby
# Good
# The create permission will be parsed from this method name
def test_create
end

# Good
# multiple permissions are defined in this method name
def test_show_and_index
end

# Good block syntax
# The permission cannot be automatically read, so you must pass the policy names directly.
test 'create' do
 refute_permit nil, Article, 'create?', 'new?'
end
```

Define multiple permissions in a method name by separating the permissions using '\_and\_'.

See the configuration section for changing the separator value.

### assert_permit and refute_permit

These methods take the following parameters:

* User to authorize
* Model or instance to authorize
* Optional array of permissions. They should match the permission method name exactly.

#### Passing permissions to assert and refute

When permissions are passed to assert or refute, the test method name is ignored and does not need to match a policy permission.

```ruby
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test
  # this method name is not parsed since the permissions
  # are passed into the method
  def test_that_a_user_can_do_stuff
    assert_permit nil, Article, 'show?', 'index?'
  end
end
```

### Using the rails test block helper

policy-assertions will work with the rails test block helper but it cannot parse the permissions. If a test block is used and the permissions are not passed to the `assert` and `refute` methods, a PolicyAssertions::MissingBlockParameters error will be thrown.

```ruby
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test
  test 'index?' do
    assert_permit @user, Article, 'index?', 'show?'
  end

  # Actions can also be passed as an array
  test 'index?' do
    assert_permit @user, Article, %w(index? show?)
  end

  # this will result in a
  # PolicyAssertions::MissingBlockParameters error
  test 'show?' do
    assert_permit @user, Article
  end
end
```

### Strong Parameters

Since Pundit offers a [permitted_attributes](https://github.com/elabs/pundit#strong-parameters) helper, policy-assertions provides an assert method for testing.

```ruby
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test
  # Test that a site staff member has access to the
  # parameters defined in the params method.
  # Site visitors should not have access to any Article attributes
  def test_strong_parameters
    params = [:title, :body, :tags]
    assert_strong_parameters(users(:staff), Article,
                             article_attributes, params)

    assert_strong_parameters(nil, Article, article_attributes, [])
  end
end
```

## Configuration

Use the following in your test helper to change the test definition permissions separator.

```ruby
PolicyAssertions.config.separator = '__separator__'
```

## How to Make Test Output Results Clear? 

You may find that the output of certain tests results are confusing. e.g.:

```shell
Expected ProjectPolicy to grant update? on #<Project:0x00007f7d04514ef0> for #<User:0x00007f7d045001a8> but it didn't
```

What is `#<User:0x00007f7d045001a8>`? 

### Simple Solution 1:

* Override `to_s` on the relevant Models.

```ruby
class User
   def to_s
      first_name + last_name
   end
end
```
### Solution 2:

If you want your `to_s` to output different resuts when testing, you could monkey patch the `to_s` method within your tests, leaving production functionality untouched.

```ruby
# e.g. test_helper
ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'
require_relative '../config/environment'
require 'rails/test_help'
require 'policy_assertions'

## Add in this module
module PatchUser
  refine User do
    def to_s
      email
    end
  end
end

# Apply the monkey patch only here
class ActiveSupport::TestCase  
  using PatchUser
  
  # etc etc.
end
```

After doing that, you will get more meaningful test message outputs:

```shell
Expected ProjectPolicy to grant update? on #<Project:0x00007f7d04514ef0> for freddie@queen.com but it didn't
```
