# policy-assertions
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ksimmons/policy-assertions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ksimmons/policy-assertions) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/policy-assertions.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/policy-assertions)

Minitest test assertions for [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) policies.

policy-assertions provides a test class for easy Pundit testing. The test class provides assertions and refutations for policies and strong parameters.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'policy-assertions'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install policy-assertions

**Add require policy\_assertions to test\_helper.rb**

```ruby
require 'policy_assertions'
```

## Usage

policy-assertions is intended to make testing Pundit policies as simple as possible. The gem adds the following helpers:

- PolicyAssertions::Test class
- parses permissions to test from method name
- assert\_permit and refute\_permit methods
- assert\_strong\_parameters

The following code sample illustrates the intended use of this gem.

```ruby
# The class is named after the policy to be tested.
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test

  # Test that the Article model allows index and show
  # for any site visitor. nil is passed in for the user.
  def test_index_and_show
    assert_permit nil, Article
  end

  # Test that a site staff member is allowed access
  # to new and create
  def test_new_and_create
    assert_permit users(:staff), Article
  end

  # Test that this user cannot delete this article
  def test_destroy
    refute_permit users(:regular), articles(:instructions)
    # Alternate method name
    asssert_not_permitted users(:regular), articles(:instructions)
  end

  # Test a permission by passing in an array instead of
  # defining it in the method name
  def test_name_is_not_a_permission
    refute_permit nil, Article, 'create?', 'new?'
  end

  # Test that a site staff member has access to the
  # parameters defined in the params array.
  # Site visitors should not have access to any Article attributes
  def test_strong_parameters
    params = [:title, :body, :tags]
    assert_strong_parameters(users(:staff), Article,
                             article_attributes, params)

    assert_strong_parameters(nil, Article, article_attributes, [])
  end
end
```

### Test method naming
policy-assertions can read the permissions to test from the method name. This will only work when using the minitest def test_name syntax, it does not work for the Rails test block helper.

```ruby
# Good
# The create permission will be parsed from this method name
def test_create
end

# Good
# multiple permissions are defined in this method name
def test_show_and_index
end

# Not good
# The permission cannot be read from this block.
test 'create' do
 # passing the permissions to the assert or refute is ok.
 refute_permit nil, Article, 'create?', 'new?'
end
```
Define multiple permissions in a method name by separating the permissions using '\_and\_'.

See the configuration section for changing the separator value.

### assert\_permit and refute\_permit
These methods take the following parameters:

- User to authorize
- Model or instance to authorize
- Optional array of permissions. They should match the permission method name exactly.

#### Passing permissions to assert and refute
When permissions are passed to assert or refute the test method name is ignored and does not need to match a policy permission.

```ruby
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test
  # this method name is not parsed since the permissions
  # are passed into the method
  def test_that_a_user_can_do_stuff
    assert_permit nil, Article, 'show?', 'index?'
  end
end
```

### Using the rails test block helper
policy-assertions will work with the rails test block helper but it cannot parse the permissions. If a test block is used and the permissions are not passed to the assert and refute methods a PolicyAssertions::MissingBlockParameters error will be thrown.

```ruby
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test
  test 'index?' do
    assert_permit @user, Article, 'index?', 'show?'
  end

  # this will result in a
  # PolicyAssertions::MissingBlockParameters error
  test 'show?' do
    assert_permit @user, Article
  end
end
```

### Strong Parameters
Since Pundit offers a [permitted_attributes](https://github.com/elabs/pundit#strong-parameters) helper, policy-assertions provides an assert method for testing.

```ruby
class ArticlePolicyTest < PolicyAssertions::Test
  # Test that a site staff member has access to the
  # parameters defined in the params method.
  # Site visitors should not have access to any Article attributes
  def test_strong_parameters
    params = [:title, :body, :tags]
    assert_strong_parameters(users(:staff), Article,
                             article_attributes, params)

    assert_strong_parameters(nil, Article, article_attributes, [])
  end
end
```
## Configure
Use the following in your test helper to change the test definition permissions separator.

```ruby
PolicyAssertions.config.separator = '__separator__'
```
